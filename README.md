# Tusker

A simple django todo list project to refresh my knowledges in django, mysql and docker containers.

## How to execute it

Literally just clone the repo into your machine and execute the docker compose file like this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matheus-artero/tusker.git
cd tusker/tusker
docker-compose up
```

More infos about django super user and password or mysql user and password will be in docker-compose.yml as well.

## After execution, how to access

Django application will be in localhost:3000 and Mysql database will be in localhost:3306. This information is available in docker-compose.yml
